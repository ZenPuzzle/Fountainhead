## [1.0.4] - 2016-07-21

### Changed

## [1.0.3] - 2016-02-10

### Changed

## [1.0.2] - 2015-02-18

### Changed
- CHANGELOG.md now CHANGELOG.txt to make it compatible with Package Control messages.


## [1.0.1] - 2015-02-18

### Changed
- Removed in-page links in README.md to improve support with https://packagecontrol.io.
- Clean up help.fountain and install.txt.

### Fixed
- References in messages.json were not correct, so install and update messages were not appearing.

## [1.0.0] - 2015-02-17
Happy to announce that version 1.0.0 has finally arrived for Fountainhead. This version is about creating a great writing and editing environment. Future versions will deal with previewing and converting screenplays.

### Added
- Ability to capitalize entire lines of text using ⌘K,K / ⌃K,K. See below for full documentation. Great when editing!
- Manual Capitalization section in the help documentation.
- Reference and link to the Input font for coding, by Font Bureau. Read more about it here: http://input.fontbureau.com
- Dialogue and Lyric syntax scopes. Lyrics are character dialogue that begin with ~.
- Ability to change between single or double line spacing after Dialogue, using the dialogue_double_line_space setting.
- README.md FAQ entry on beginning characters that end in a period (e.g., JR.) with an "@".

### Changed
- Scene and Character lists retain their capitalization as entered, which means they will most likely be in all uppercase letters (except @ characters). Great when editing!
- Improved support for default Sublime Text Color Schemes. Dialogue and Lyrics default to foreground (Action) colors, and Characters default to string scopes.
- All version updates combined into a single change log (CHANGELOG.md).
- All color schemes to use the new Dialog, Lyrics, and Character scopes.

### Fixed
- Removed Default.sublime-keymap, which was causing conflicts with the Default (OSX).sublime-keymap file, and is redundant with the Linux and Windows keymap files.
- Scene and Character pop-up menus are updated properly when new scenes/characters are entered (Sublime Text 3 feature).
- Pressing Enter/Return at the end of a parenthetical will no longer make the line uppercase.
- Dialogue that is not a complete sentence will no longer be automatically capitalized when Enter/Return is pressed.

### Notes

#### Manual Capitalization

For those times that manual capitalization is needed (e.g., edits), the following commands are provided:

Key Combination     | Performs the Following Action
--------------------|-------------------------------
⌘K,⌘L / ⌃K,⌃L (1) | Convert highlighted text to lowercase
⌘K,⌘U / ⌃K,⌃U (1) | Convert highlighted text to uppercase
⌘K,K / ⌃K,K (2)    | Capitalize the entire line

(1) The comma is used to separate the sequence of key presses (X,Y is equal to "Press X, and then press Y").

(2) All commands use lowercase letters (e.g., K is equal to pressing k), unless preceded by ⇧/Shift.

The above commands can also be selected through the use of menus:

Tools > Fountainhead > Convert to Lowercase
Tools > Fountainhead > Convert to Uppercase
Tools > Fountainhead > Capitalize Current Line
or
Tools > Command Palette (⇧⌘P / ⇧⌃P) and entering "Fountainhead: Convert to Lowercase"
Tools > Command Palette (⇧⌘P / ⇧⌃P) and entering "Fountainhead: Convert to Uppercase"
Tools > Command Palette (⇧⌘P / ⇧⌃P) and entering "Fountainhead: Capitalize Current Line"
